# Object Oriented Programming

This repository contains my work on the _Object Oriented Programming_ Course.

## Contents

It focuses on developing **interactive GUI** applications using the Qt framework, but also it contains a
small example of a C "complex" application resembling a [Family Budget](https://github.com/culbec/OOP/tree/main/Family_Budget_C).

### [Car Dealership](https://github.com/culbec/Qt_OOP_Cars)

This is my project for the semester, which resembles a _Car Dealership_ from real life. It allows a user to 
apply car specific functionalities, for _file stored_ cars.

## Technologies used

- C/C++: **code**
- Qt: **interactive GUI**
